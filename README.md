# Mapping_Earthquakes
Use the Leaflet.js Application Programming Interface (API) to populate a geographical map with GeoJSON earthquake data from a URL

• Create a branch from the master branch on GitHub.<br>
• Add, commit, and push data to a GitHub branch.<br>
• Merge a branch with the master branch on GitHub.<br>
• Retrieve data from a GeoJSON file.<br>
• Make API requests to a server to host geographical maps.<br>
• Populate geographical maps with GeoJSON data using JavaScript and the Data-Driven Documents (D3) library.<br>
• Add multiple map layers to geographical maps using Leaflet control plugins to add user interface controls.<br>
• Use JavaScript ES6 functions to add GeoJSON data, features, and interactivity to maps.<br>
• Render maps on a local server.


## Challenge 13
Add a third map style as an additional tile layer, add tectonic plate GeoJSON data to the map to illustrate the relationship between the location and frequency of seismic activity and tectonic plates.

•	Use d3.json() to get tectonic plate data and add the data using the L.geoJSON() layer. <br>
•	Style the tectonic plate LineString data to stand out on the map.<br>
•	Add the tectonic plate data as an overlay with the earthquake data.<br>
•	Add a third map style to allow the user to select from three different maps.
